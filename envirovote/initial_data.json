This year’s crop of doe-eyed, long-limbed beauties include Janet, an aesthetician from Georgia who looks like she’s been in front of a camera or two; Kimberly, an Ali Larter doppelganger; and the sixth Sara/Sarah to compete in the show (the last five were less than spectacular).\n\nFashion icon Twiggy, photographer Nigel Barker, and runway expert J. Alexander are back for another season behind the judges' table. I’m curious to see what Miss J will be using to countdown the fallen models. First it was numbers, then ruffles. Might I suggest a subtle, yet fierce candelabrum this year?"

Lisa Madigan’s office, which has complained about Blagojevich’s use of private law firms to represent state agencies, had asked that the firm of Meckler, Bulger and Tilson be prevented from representing the Department of Children and Family Services in the case of Anita Mahajan, who is accused of billing the state for drug tests that her firm, K.K. Bio-Science, did not perform.\n\nMadigan’s office argued that only the attorney general has the authority to represent state agencies in court or hire outside firms for that work."
